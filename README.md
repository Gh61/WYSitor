# WYSitor
WYSitor is WYSIWYG HTML Editor for WPF.

## Introduction
I needed WPF HTML editor for our aplication, so i started searching existing projects. There are some editors in big library packs, that are priced too high for our ussage.
Then there is project [SmithHtmlEditor](https://github.com/adambarath/SmithHtmlEditor) wich I [forked and migrated to .NET 4.5](https://github.com/Gh61/EasyHtmlEditor) (for usage in our project). In my experience it was very unstable and need many fixes.

So I came around [this solution](https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/870549/Csharp-WPF-WYSIWYG-HTML-Editor) wich is my inspiration for this project. *Though it's similar to SmithHtmlEditor, but it's using native WPF WebBrowser (not WindowsFormsHost).*
